Yesterday I conducted an experiment in which I tested how long will 1 12V battery power 1 meter of led strip. 

Strip worked for at least __7 hours__... __WHY?!__

I used:
- 1 meter of 12V Led Strip (30 LED/m) with 2.4W/m power consumption (according to the documentation). 
- 1 x 12V A23 50mAh battery.

If specification was correct my strip should be power by current around (_2.4W / 12V = 0.2A_) 200mA. Battery have 50mAh capacity so it should last (_50mAh / 200mA = 0.25h_) around 15 minutes. 

__So, why it worked for 7 hours?__

My first guess is that battery simple can't supply so much power and efective current was much smaller but LED can still work only dimmer that in specification.

I will do some mesurements and come back to this topic...
