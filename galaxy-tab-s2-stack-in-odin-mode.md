Today I turn on by mistake ODIN mode on my Galaxy Tab S2 (T715). I did this by clicking and holding HOME + VOLUME DOWN + POWER and then clicking VOLUME UP.
To my surprise you can't leave ODIN mode by clicking and holding POWER button even for 10s.

Turns out that you have to **click and hold HOME + VOLUME DOWN + POWER for 3s** to leave ODIN mode and restart your device.
