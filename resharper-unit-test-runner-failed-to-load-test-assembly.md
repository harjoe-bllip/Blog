Today I stepped on a odd resharper tests error. I run unit test using a test runner and received a Unit Test Runner failed to load test assembly exception.

It turned out I have unwittingly change Unit Test Sessions Framework combobox to CLR2.

Problem was resolved after changing but to Framework: Auto.
