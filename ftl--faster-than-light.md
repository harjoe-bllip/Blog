This may not by a developer news but last night I stepped on very funny and addictive little Steam game: FTL: Faster Than Light and so passed 4h of my life :/

Game is simple and easy to learn but extremely hard to finish. It takes around 30 minutes to finish the game but you can't save and every time you make some stupid mistake you end up starting from the beginning and you will find many mistake to make ;). From attacking ship that is to strong for you to finding random quest that will kill 1 of your crew member.
Nether the less randomness of game levels, many weapons, drones, ships and ways to kill your opponent will keep you playing for hours.

Pros:
	- Fun
	- Addictive
	- Simple
	- Spaceships!
	- Good music
Cons:
	- Addictive. I had to install this game to stop playing ;)
	- Little too hard and unpredictable
	- Too expensive (10$)
	- No android port
My score: (7/10)
