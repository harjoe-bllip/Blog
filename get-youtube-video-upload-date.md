Have You ever wonder what is exact upload date of YouTube video? I have. 
Fortunately YouTube provides xml API which enables Us to retrieve all metadata about a video. [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_video_entries).

I however went one step further and created PowerShell script that gives you exact date in your local timezone.
