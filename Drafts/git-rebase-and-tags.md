In big project I'm working on we mark project version by creating git tag with name "v1.43.0.2" every time project is deployed on TEST environment. Then retrieve current version using command:
```ps
	git describe --tags --abbrev=0
```

This works nice most of the time but if you will create new tag e.g. "v1.44.0.0" and then try to merge origin using *git rebase* you're gonna have a bad time.

Rebase will stash your changes, download origin and apply changes again. This causes git to recreate your commits with new SHA-1 which is ok but tag will still be connected to old SHA-1 and will be disconnected from the branch.
